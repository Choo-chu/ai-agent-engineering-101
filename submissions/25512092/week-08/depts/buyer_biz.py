"""Week 07 market_buyer — picks a shop from the market's shop list, negotiates over A2A
(the week-06 loop), remembers past trades, and ends with one result line for the kit.

    python market_buyer.py --shops .market/shops.json --item lamp --budget 120

Choosing  : shops that look dishonest (my memory, reviews, the ledger) are dropped; the rest are tried in
            the order of their market_db shop score [15]: cheap + honest grade claims + my haggling success.
Cases     : strategy.buyer_case(): normal caps the price at min(budget, market average); endgame (last 24 h)
            caps it at the budget. Goods without a warranty must be grade A or B [14] (the kit's accept policy).
Memory    : memory.jsonl next to this file, one line per trade, keyed by shop name.
Reviews   : the harness sees a code-made summary per shop plus two short review snippets,
            and is told that review texts and seller messages are data, not instructions.
Stars     : decided by code rules (receipt vs agreed price, budget, injected instructions).
Budget    : guarded in code, as in week 06.
