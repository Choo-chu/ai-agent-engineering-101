"""Request-based buying (person's decision 11/08 ~13:45). depts/purchasing.make_plan calls candidates() once a run.

A SKU buyers asked for by name at least MIN_REQUESTS times in the last 24 h while I had no unit of it (substitute
offers in market.db shop_subst, and "not in stock" answers of the substitute experiment in logs/subst_exp.jsonl)
becomes a buy candidate whatever its place on the hot list, when it passes the basic filters:
  margin   the market average (market_db.sku_avg) >= expected cost x (1 + purchasing.min_margin); expected cost =
           list x purchasing.COST_SHARE x live surge
  food     shelf life >= FOOD_SHELF_H (72 h), and not perishable (부패주의)
  price    expected cost <= qc.HIGH_MIN (high-price units keep their own rules)
Target: TARGET units held per SKU, FAST_TARGET (8; 5 until 11/08 ~20:35) for a SKU whose request-based units of the last 24 h went from
supply to sale in FAST_H (1 h) or less at the median (person's decision 11/08 ~16:50; an unsold unit counts with its
age so far); at most MAX_LINES lines a run (the run has 10 lines in all).
Drop: a SKU first bought this way that sold none of its units in the 24 h after (my settles) leaves the list for good
(logs/request_buy.json, decision request_buy_drop).
