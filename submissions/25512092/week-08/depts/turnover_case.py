"""Overstock by turnover (person's decision 11/09 ~23:40). While the automatic STOCK_CAP is on (limits.auto_cap_on), the
CEO's shop case (depts/ceo.raw_shop_case) is overstock only when
  1. the median supply -> sale time of my units sold in the last WINDOW_H (6 h) is over MEDIAN_H (3 h), with at least
     MIN_SALES (10) sales, or
  2. of the units supplied in the last SUPPLY_H (24 h, and not before the automatic cap was switched on) that are at
     least OLD_H (6 h) old, the share of their cost still unsold is over OLD_SHARE (25%), judged once their cost is at
     least MIN_COST (5M)
(the same two measures as the cap brake, depts/cap_brake.py). "stock >= cap" and low cash are not overstock then: low
cash only stops buying (the restock budget is cash - 3M), the price floors stay normal.
Thresholds: stock_cap_auto.json "case" ({median_h, window_h, min_sales, old_h, old_share, supply_h, min_cost,
unsold_min, consecutive}).
From 11/09 ~23:50 (person), the same as the cap brake: median 4 h, unsold share 35% AND unsold cost over 5M, and
overstock only on `consecutive` (2) checks in a row at least MIN_GAP_S apart (the CEO case tick is every 5 min); the
first hit sends a Telegram warning (decision overstock_warn) and the case stays normal. State: logs/turnover_case.json.
