"""High-price first asks against the market average (person's decision 11/08 ~17:00), switched by high_ask.json

  cap      a high-price unit (cost > qc.HIGH_MIN) never asks first above the market average (market_db.price_of, the
           same average the buyers' market shows); the floor does not change, so the ask is max(floor, min(ask, avg))

           market median: cost x 1.05. Sofas keep their own rules (depts/sofa.applies), the endgame keeps its markdown,
           and a floor computed by an old markdown (aging, stoploss, food clearance, endgame, cash_low, overstock)
           that is lower than the new floor stays (one principle, 11/08 ~17:50). The first-ask cap above stays (the ask is never under the floor)
