"""Which case the shop and the buyer are in, and the rules each case turns on. restock.py calls tick() every
minute; the case is decided at most every CASE_EVERY_S and stored in market.db (table cases).

  shop case (first match wins)
    endgame    from 48 h before the round ends    floor: endgame markdown (pricing.endgame), restock from
                                                   normal rules until 36 h before the end, then none
    cash_low   cash < CASH_RESERVE (1.5M)          floor: cost; no restock (warning in the log under 1M)
    overstock  stock at cost >= STOCK_CAP (4.0M)   floor: cost, or the aging markdown when lower; no restock
               (hysteresis: it ends only when stock falls under STOCK_EXIT, 3.52M)
    normal     otherwise                           floor: max(cost, market average); restock with the

    always on: food clearance (the lower floor wins) and answers to '구합니다' posts (forum_post.py)

  A case holds at least MIN_HOLD_S (30 min) after it changes, except that entering endgame or cash_low happens
  at once. decide() is the one place that picks a case; everything else reads it through current().

  buyer case
    endgame    from 24 h before the end            cap = budget (the market's mandate still limits it)
    normal     otherwise                           cap = min(budget, market average); SKU by expected
                                                   surplus; C-grade goods only with a warranty; shop score
