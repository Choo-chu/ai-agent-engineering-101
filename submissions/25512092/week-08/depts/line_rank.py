"""Restock line priority by expected profit (person's decision 11/09 ~14:35, "고가 집중"), switched by line_rank.json
(read every restock run). The request-based lines (depts/request_buy.py, up to 4) keep going first; the other lines
are no longer filled in the scan order (hot, wanted, then by sales in 30 min) but by expected profit per line:
    expected margin x expected units sold x sale price = (market avg - est. cost) x expected units
    expected units = min(planned qty, market sales of the SKU in the last 24 h / 24 x HORIZON_H x my share)
then each line gets what its tier's budget (low / high) and the high-price unit room still allow, up to MAX_LINES.
Every filter that decides whether a SKU may be bought at all (margin, break, high-price guard, first-ask check,
sofa rules, exclusions, perishables) is unchanged: they run before the ranking.
